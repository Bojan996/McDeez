Welcome to McDeez official, a high class restaurant from my imagination.
This is a complete web application for a restaurant which has fully working commenting, career aplying, and order taking functionalities.

Of course that’s not all. The best part of it is that It allows users to manually make their own food which of course McDeez then cooks and delivers. 

Navigate to the menu page and there you shall see the premade menu (for people who don’t like to experiment), the “be creative” menu (in which you can make your own burger, pizza, salad and waffle), and the menu for the additional stuff such as fries, drinks, ice creams etc.

The pictures that you see for the “be creative menu” were all drawn by me in Figma, then exported as svg’s and presented to the users. 
Of course the application also has an authentication logic which is managed by firebase. With no account, you can not order food. 

After your first order, in the Orders page (by sending a query string to the firebase database and checking all orders and extracting the ones that match the user ID) you will be presented with your past orders and of course there will be an option to order it again. 

Also, the application is fully responsive so go ahead and enjoy it with your phone or tablet as well (or any other device). 

Overall, I really recommend you to check out the application, dive into the code, and enjoy the experience as a user of the application.
